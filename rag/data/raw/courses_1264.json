The main focus of this course is to introduce these tools and methods for kinematic and dynamic modelling approaches. These new approaches allow more intuitive and geometrical representation of motion and interaction in any articulated multi-body system such as robotics devices. The course offers valuable background for students involved in computer graphics (e.g. animation), human/machine interface (e.g. haptic interface), control engineers (e.g. trajectory planning, master/slave system) and robotic designers. The course involves individual projects in modelling and co-ordination of a robotic device.",

But the power of sport in reinforcing and naturalizing racial inequality continues while the naturalness and inevitability of sex segregation in sport remains largely unchallenged.
