But the power of sport in reinforcing and naturalizing racial inequality continues while the naturalness and inevitability of sex segregation in sport remains largely unchallenged.

Upon admission to the PhD program, each student must enroll in this course each semester. A SATISFACTORY grade is granted once the student submits a written research proposal and successfully defends it during an oral presentation before her/his supervisory committee. The candidacy exam must be completed after 6 terms enrollment. Under special circumstances, and subject to approval by the Supervisory and Graduate Program committees, a student who does not pass the exam (UNSATISFACTORY grade) may be given a second chance by enrolling in MSE 890 one more time.
