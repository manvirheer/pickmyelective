The course aims to raise their communication performance to a professionally acceptable level, rather than to memorize or theorize about communication knowledge: this is a “learn-by-doing” course. Students will improve their ability to conceptualize, analyze/evaluate, synthesize, and apply information to guide their thinking and finished products across various business contexts. As teamwork is a fundamental skill valued by employers, students will participate in a major team project to learn about and apply best practices for collaboration with respect to professional business communication. The primary means of instruction and learning is guided practice in both writing and presenting in response to realistic business contexts. Instruction and assessment focus on both the process of creating professional, finished products, as well as the quality of those products.\n\nGood for students interested in: business communication, professional writing, oral communication, teamwork collaboration, communication strategies, business presentations, critical thinking, information synthesis",
